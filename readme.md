#Random Process Hijacking tools!
These are all proof-of-concept, put together from patched and modified public domain code from around the web and analysis of certain programs.

###Virus scanners
- Your virus scanner may very well block these; after all these programs are just an exposed version of techniques commonly used by malware. We hope to improve security by making these techniques public, so antivirus can be designed to detect them.
- See [VirusTotal's unsurprising detections for this project's binaries](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/04b4ff1d197588caa7deba21454dd44880f1d137c6c7a69655caf533b2390c49/analysis/1448843366/).

By using this code and/or the binaries affiliated with this code, you agree to not use this code for any malicious purpose; doing so is strictly prohibited and is against the spirit of this project.
